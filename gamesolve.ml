                        Problem Set 5: Search
 
			     Game Solving

This file contains the signature for a GAMESOLVER module as well as a
higher-order functor, MakeGameSolver. A GAMESOLVER module solves the
game by searching for a path from the initial state to the goal state.

The MakeGameSolver functor takes in a collection functor and a
GAMEDESCRIPTION and returns a GAMESOLVER. The collection specified by
the functor is used to store the states that have been reached so
far. Thus, the ordering in which states are delivered by the
collection (with the take function) determines the order in which the
states are searched. A stack regime gives depth-first search, a queue
regime breadth-first search.

At the bottom of the file are definitions for a depth-first search and
breadth-first game solvers, partially applied versions of the
MakeGameSolver functor that use certain collections to engender
different search methods.
